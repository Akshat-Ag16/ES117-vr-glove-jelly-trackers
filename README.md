# ES117: Haptic VR Glove with Force Feedback and Jelly Trackers for full body simulation

This project was built by a team of 30+ first-year students at IIT Gandhinagar from different streams of engineering. We built this project within 4 months and received compliments from the instructor, jury and peers alike. This project helped us build a spirit of teamwork and utilise everyone's skillset in the team. I had co-delivered and ideated the presentation and pitching segment.
